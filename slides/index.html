# aws-elastic-beanstalk
Here We are, thank you for your time and interest going through this repo.
<br>*https://github.com/Mladen-Trampic-SRB-1989/aws-elastic-beanstalk*
    
<br>We are about to make fast pass through Elastic Beanstalk and docker deployment, hope you like my way of learning and sharing in the process.

## Just me, setting up expectations right:

</p>

- Who am I ?
    - [Working nomad and having loads of fun in process. [ Serbia -> Italy -> Ireland -> Austria ]](http://mladen.trampic.info)
    - [Proud father, husband, brother and humble son.](https://www.instagram.com/djombla/?hl=en)
    <br>*In nutshell , not much free time, but many wishes and ideas.*

***

## Hence, what is the idea here ?
- Deploy Web Application ( / Service / API .. ) or migrate to cloud with minimal effort, to move towards becoming Cloud Native[1].
- Requirements:
    - Fully managed service ( I want to focus on Development and code )
    - No additional pricing other than running resources
    - Future proof / extendable with CI/CD
    - ...

***

## Ok, Cloud, Why Cloud and AWS?

| Elasticity  | Scale on demand <br> No overhead capacity ( What you need / When you need ) <br> Regionalization : AWS now spans 69 Availability Zones within 22 geographic regions around the world. |
| Flexibility | Low to no cost to entry <br> Large portfolio of managed services / 3rd Party on Marketplace                                                                                           |

- Natural habitat for DevOps and automation.

## Ok, what can it offer to me to achieve my requirements ?

### Magical Answer:
- [Elastic Beanstalk from AWS ?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/Welcome.html)
  <br>Hmm, Name of the service Beanstalk, reminds me on cartoon I used to love to watch when I was kid, Jack and the Beanstalk. 
  <br>( Although, in 90's in Serbia there were not so many :D )
  - **But wait, is this my magical beanstalk to the mythical castle of work life balance promised with DevOps automation and running stuff the cloud ?**

| Agility     | Fast to pick up <br> Easy to play around <br> time to deliver reduced <br> Integration made easy  |

## What do I have ?
- Critical branding CV Web Page running in complex datacenter, that often forces me to have sleepless nights.
<br> This happens during hype periods, when people are visiting my page seeking for more information about me, cuasing overload to my complex local resources, meaning - downtime. This makes my reputation to sustain unrecoverable damage. :-(
<br> Error 50* - [Troubleshootng](https://www.interserver.net/tips/kb/troubleshoot-500-internal-server-error/)
<br>Meanwhile, my rep suffer @ http://mladen.trampic.info
